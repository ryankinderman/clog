          At long last, I've finally got my blog up using a decent engine. I started off using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, but the PHP made my little object-oriented heart ache. I would like to thank <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matsumoto San</a>, for bringing us <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeir Hansson</a> for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, and <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/">Tobias Luetke</a> for <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a>.

          Before you attempt to write a single line of XML parsing code in Java, make sure that you read <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-injava/">this article</a>. I've been working on my first Java project that involves processing XML data, and I started by using the functionality provided by the Java 1.4.2 runtime. I'd like to warn you that this is probably <i>not</i> the best option if you want to do basic XML processing.

          I believe that amongst the chief traits of highly-productive computer users is the ability to manage and manipulate a number of different applications at once, and effectively switch between them (also known as "multitasking" by some, but I find that term misleading).  This ability often includes an aversion to using the mouse. A seasoned developer, for example, would rather <code>ALT+F4</code> than reach for the mouse to close a window. Using the keyboard requires much less knowledge of a display's spacial relationships, the consideration of which distracts from what a person is often using a computer for to begin with: to get work done efficiently.
