- CommandLine should:
  - only interact with Blog
  - provide the commands 'pull' and 'post'
  - pass blog client information to Blog
  - use Blog to fulfill pull/post commands, but not rely on it for:
    - writing to filesystem
    - implementing commands pull/post
- Blog should not exist?
  - get a Command implementations for CommandLine to use
  - rely on CommandLine to instantiate XmlRpc client
- separate Post logic from Xmlrpc::Post
  - Post contains logic for reading and writing clog files
  - Xmlrpc::Post contains logic to:
    - write post data to Xmlrpc::Client
    - read post data from Xmlrpc::Client
    - convert post data to/from Clog::Post
- remove duplication of knowledge for metaweblog response
- work out proper place to create a Post (blog? client?)
- consolidate usage message and command/argument definition
