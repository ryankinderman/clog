- work out proper place to create a Post (blog? client?)
  - CommandLine should:
    - only interact with Blog
    - provide the commands 'pull' and 'post'
    - pass blog client information to Blog
    - use Blog to fulfill pull/post commands, but not rely on it for:
      - writing to filesystem
      - implementing commands pull/post
  - Blog should not exist?
    - get a Command implementations for CommandLine to use
    - rely on CommandLine to instantiate XmlRpc client
  - separate Post logic from Xmlrpc::Post
    - Post contains logic for reading and writing clog files
    - Xmlrpc::Post contains logic to:
      - write post data to Xmlrpc::Client
      - read post data from Xmlrpc::Client
      - convert post data to/from Clog::Post
- remove duplication of knowledge for metaweblog response
- consolidate usage message and command/argument definition
- features
